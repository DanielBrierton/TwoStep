TwoStep
=======
TwoStep is a simple Firefox OS app for generating Time-based One Time Passwords. It uses the [Firefox OS Building Blocks](http://buildingfirefoxos.com/building-blocks) to provide a native and consistent UI.

It is currently untested and unfinished, and therefore has not yet been submitted to the Firefox Marketplace.
